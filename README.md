# WebAPI (.NET 6)

This is a Blog Web API developed as part of my software development portfolio. Built with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and Identity, the API supports user registration, login, and logout using JWT-based authentication.

The API enables users to create and manage blog posts under two main categories based on mood type and post type. Users have the option to either publish their posts immediately or save them as drafts for future publication. This setup demonstrates essential features such as authentication, authorization, role management, and CRUD operations using modern .NET technologies.

* WebAPI.Client and WebApp projects are still under development.
